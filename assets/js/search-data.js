        description: "研究人类大脑的功能动态有助于揭示内在的认知系统。本研究采用基于图注意力网络（Graph Attention Network, GAT）的异常检测技术，以识别功能时间序列中的突变。本研究使用了来自人类连接组项目（Human Connectome Project）1010 名参与者的静息态功能磁共振成像（fMRI）数据。通过应用多变量时间序列的异常检测方法，识别出三种不同的大脑状态，分别命名为 S1、S2 和 S3。这篇文章进一步为每种状态生成了功能连接的低维表示（即梯度），并比较了这些状态之间的差异。结果表明，S1 和 S3 表现出分离的网络模式，而 S2 则呈现更为整合的模式。基于图论的拓扑分析显示，整合状态（S2）具有较强的区域间连接性。两个分离状态则呈现出不同的功能特征，其中 S1 主要涉及体感运动网络，S3 则与更高阶的联合区相关。本研究对大脑状态之间的转换进行了评估，发现从低阶感官状态（S1）到高阶默认模式状态（S3），以及从感官分离状态（S1）到整合状态（S2）的转换，与感官/运动和记忆相关任务相关；而从整合状态（S2）到与默认模式区域相关的分离状态（S3）的转换，则与语言和奖励任务相关联。这些发现表明，本研究提出的方法能够捕捉个体层级的大脑动态变化，进而实现对内在动态大脑系统的评估。",
